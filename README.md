# League Auto Login  

This was created for people with many accounts. This will allow you to hotswap between your accounts and keep the data encrpyted in a local json file.
I created this software to get a better understanding of how reading and writing data to json files works.  

This application has [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) dependancies  

## Features
